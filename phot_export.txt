                           Program PHOT_EXPORT
                             30 December 2016

phot_export [options]

Export photographs from the IMG directory into a release directory.  The
release directory structure will be similar to a film directory structure,
with the single top level "index.htm" that shows thumbnails and is the
root for navigating thru all the pictures.

The command line options are:

  <filename>

    Gives the name of the images list file, which is required.

    Each line contains the name of one picture to export.  This name must
    be the film name followed by a dash followed by the picture name
    within that film.  For example "cn119-04" indicates frame 04 within
    film CN119.

    All pictures for the film are assumed to be in a subdirector of the
    film name within the /IMG directory.  If the list file name ends in
    ".txt", then FILENAME may be only the generic file name (without the
    ".txt").

    Blank lines and lines with the first printable character being "*" are
    ignored.

  -NORIG

    Suppresses creating of the ORIG subdirectory within the release
    directory.  The highest resolution images will have 1024 pixels in the
    largest dimension.  The "original" versions of each pictures will not
    be available in the release.

  -BY

    Write the "Created by" information for each picture when this is
    available.  The default is to not write this information.

The release directory will be "release" in the current directory where
this program is run.  If the release directory previously exist, it will
be deleted and then re-created with the new information.
